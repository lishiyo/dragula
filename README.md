A miniature drag n' drop demo in Kotlin. :sparkles:

#### :smiling_imp: Some things you can do:
- You can drag around any of the Blocks on the canvas.
- You can put up to three Image Blocks in a row.
- You can re-order those Blocks, or drag them out to their own row.
- But Text Blocks will always take up an entire row.
- You can trash any Block. :x:
- If you need new ones, just drag from the bottom bar to get some fresh new blocks :bread: :yum:

#### TODOs

- Add your own text and photos :tada:
- More layout designs
- Drag edges to resize and make flex layouts :hushed:
- :shipit:
