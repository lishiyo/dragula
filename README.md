# Dragula!

A miniature drag n' drop demo in Kotlin.

Some things you can do:
- You can drag around any of the Blocks on the canvas.
- You can put up to three Image Blocks in a row.
- You can re-order those Blocks, or drag them out to their own row.
- But Text Blocks will always take up an entire row.
- You can trash any Block.
- If you need new ones, just drag from the bottom bar to get some fresh new blocks. :bread:
