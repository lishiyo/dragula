# Dragula!

A miniature drag n' drop demo in Kotlin.

Some things you can do:
- You can drag around any of the blocks on the canvas.
- You can put up to three image blocks in a single row.
- You can re-order those blocks, or drag them out to their own row.
- But text blocks will always take up an entire row.
- You can trash any block.
- If you need new ones, just drag from the bottom bar to get some fresh new blocks.
